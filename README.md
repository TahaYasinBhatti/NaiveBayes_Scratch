# NaiveBayes_Scratch
Naive Bayes Algorithm Implementation from Scratch for Binary Classification 

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multi-class classification problems. 

## Representation for naive Bayes is probabilities

A list of probabilities are stored to file for a learned naive Bayes model. This includes:

1. Class Probabilities: The probabilities of each class in the training dataset.
2. Conditional Probabilities: The conditional probabilities of each input value given each class value.

## The main function of the Algorithm are listed below
1. Preprocessing ( Create X,y)
2. Calcualte Class Probability  (Calcualte Probability for the Binary Classes) 
3. Maximum Likelyhood Estimation (Likely hood Estimation)
4. Fit (Train Naive Bayes)
5. Predict (Predict the Probability on the Test Case)
